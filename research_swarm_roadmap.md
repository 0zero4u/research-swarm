# Research Swarm Pipeline — Simplified for Dissertation Writing

**Last Updated:** 2026-05-26
**Status:** Ready for Implementation (v2 — Simplified)

---

## MISSION

Build a dissertation-writing assistant that:
1. Generates full chapter-length academic content (6-8 pages per chapter)
2. Every sentence backed by evidence from source PDFs
3. Page-level provenance: every citation traceable to a specific page
4. Produces proper MLA-formatted dissertation chapters
5. Simple, maintainable RAG pipeline — no overengineering

## CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **NO SENTENCE WITHOUT EVIDENCE** — Every claim maps to a chunk with page number
2. **SIMPLE RAG** — Semantic search over PDFs, no graph complexity
3. **CHEAP MODELS RETRIEVE / SMART MODELS WRITE**
4. **PAGE-LEVEL PROVENANCE** — Every citation: [author, page]
5. **FULL CHAPTERS** — Generate 6-8 page sections, not 3-paragraph samples

## SIMPLIFIED PIPELINE

```
Source PDFs (novel, film script, 10-15 secondary sources)
        ↓
PDF Extraction (PyMuPDF) → preserve page numbers
        ↓
Chunking (page-level or 500-token, preserve paragraph)
        ↓
Embedding + Vector Store (simple FAISS or sqlite-vector)
        ↓
Semantic Search (top-k relevant chunks)
        ↓
Evidence Pack (text + [author, page, source_id])
        ↓
Writer Agent (generates full chapter section)
        ↓
Output (chapter section with traceable citations)
```

---

## PHASE 1 — DOWNLOADER AGENT

**Model:** `qwen/qwen3.5-plus` via OpenRouter

**Goal:** Download PDFs from URLs and convert to clean text

**Process:**
1. Receive list of URLs from user
2. Download each PDF
3. Extract text using PyMuPDF
4. Save to `corpus/{source_id}.txt`
5. Update `metadata.json` with status

**Output:** `corpus/*.txt` + `metadata.json`

**Folder Structure:**
```
corpus/
├── 001_train_to_pakistan.txt
├── 002_literature_review.txt
└── metadata.json
```

**Model Note:** Downloader uses qwen/qwen3.5-plus to handle complex URLs, retry logic, error handling.

---

## PHASE 2 — PDF EXTRACTION

**Goal:** Convert PDFs to clean text with page mapping

**Tool:** PyMuPDF (fitz)

**Rules:**
- Preserve page numbers exactly
- Remove headers/footers/page numbers from text
- Keep paragraph structure intact
- Track: page_number → original_pdf_page

**Output:** `corpus/NOV_001/cleaned.txt`

---

## PHASE 3 — CHUNKING + PROVENANCE

**Goal:** Create retrievable chunks with full provenance

**Chunking Rules:**
- Page-level chunks (one page = one chunk, or split long pages)
- Soft max: 500 tokens per chunk
- Never split mid-sentence
- Attach metadata: source_id, author, page, section_title

**Chunk Schema:**
```json
{
  "chunk_id": "NOV_001_P004",
  "source_id": "NOV_001",
  "author": "Khushwant Singh",
  "page": 4,
  "section": "Chapter 1",
  "text": "The train came late at night...",
  "type": "primary"
}
```

**Deliverable:** `chunks.json`

---

## PHASE 4 — VECTOR INDEXING

**Goal:** Enable semantic search over chunks

**Embedder:** `qwen/qwen3-embedding-8b` via OpenRouter (1024 dimensions)
**Vector Store:** FAISS

**Storage:**
- `chunks.json` — all chunk metadata + text
- `vector_index/` — FAISS index file

**No complex metadata in vector store** — keep provenance in chunks.json, not embedded.

---

## PHASE 5 — RETRIEVAL

**Goal:** Given a query/topic, return relevant evidence

**Pipeline:**
```
query/topic string
    ↓
semantic search (top-10 chunks by cosine similarity)
    ↓
filter by confidence threshold (>= 0.4)
    ↓
evidence pack
```

**Evidence Pack:**
```json
{
  "chunk_id": "NOV_001_P004",
  "author": "Khushwant Singh",
  "page": 4,
  "source_title": "Train to Pakistan",
  "type": "primary",
  "text": "The train came late at night...",
  "similarity": 0.82
}
```

**Confidence Thresholds:**
- >= 0.65: normal
- 0.40-0.65: low_confidence (flag)
- < 0.40: reject

---

## PHASE 6 — WRITER AGENT

**Goal:** Generate full chapter section from evidence packs

**Input:**
- Chapter topic/subheading
- Evidence packs (list of relevant chunks)
- Writing style: academic, formal, MLA tone

**Rules:**
1. Every paragraph must cite evidence: (Author, Page)
2. No invented citations
3. No unsupported claims
4. Quote directly when using exact phrases
5. Paraphrase with citation otherwise

**Output Format:**
```markdown
## 1.1 Partition of India

The historiography of the Partition reveals... (Singh, 4).

[Generated paragraph with citations...]

## 1.2 About the Author

[Next section...]
```

**Writer Model:** `qwen/qwen3-72B-Instruct` via OpenRouter

---

## PHASE 7 — VALIDATION

**Goal:** Verify citations before final output

**Checks per paragraph:**
- [ ] Every citation has matching chunk in chunks.json
- [ ] Page number exists in source
- [ ] Claim matches chunk text (not hallucinated)
- [ ] MLA format correct: (Author Page)

**If validation fails:**
- Re-run retrieval with lower threshold
- Flag for human review

## STACK

| Component | Model | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Downloader** | `qwen/qwen3.5-plus` | OpenRouter |
| **PDF Extraction** | PyMuPDF | Fast, page-accurate |
| **Embedding** | `qwen/qwen3-embedding-8b` | OpenRouter, 1024 dim |
| **Vector Store** | FAISS | Simple, local, fast |
| **Writer LLM** | `qwen/qwen3-72B-Instruct` | OpenRouter |
| **Citation Format** | MLA | (Author Page) |

## WHAT WE REMOVED (vs v1)

- ~~Citation graph construction~~ — not needed
- ~~Theme graph + theme_index~~ — overengineered
- ~~Relationship-first retrieval~~ — simple semantic search sufficient
- ~~LightRAG~~ — too complex for dissertation corpus
- ~~Cross-encoder reranker~~ — embedding similarity good enough
- ~~Phase 7 citation expansion~~ — manual citation lookup for unavailable refs
- ~~50-sentence stratified validation~~ — per-paragraph check sufficient

| Phase 3 | ✅ Done | Chunker agent (chunks.json) |
| Phase 4 | ✅ Done | Embedder (qwen3-embedding-8b → FAISS) |
| Phase 5 | ✅ Done | RAG retriever (FAISS + rag_retriever_skill) |
| Phase 6 | ✅ Done | AcademicWriterAgent (calls rag-pull internally, hybrid citations) |
| Phase 7 | ✅ Done | Humanizer agent (29 AI pattern categories) |
| Phase 8 | ✅ Done | Citation auditor |

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Collect PDFs**: Get the novel PDF + film transcript
2. **Download secondary sources**: Find 10-15 academic papers/books on Partition literature
3. **Run pipeline**: Extract → Chunk → Index → Query (rag_retriever_skill) → Write ([B_XXX]) → Format → Humanize → Audit
4. **Generate Chapter 1 (Introduction)** as first output
5. **Iterate** for remaining chapters
